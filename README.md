# college-network
I have tried and created a model of our college network in the packet tracer. This is a basic model to understand how different networking devices connect to each other.
The internal configurations of each device is also done so that the simulation also works and will help you to understand the process in depth.


<- Requirements ->
* Cisco Packet Tracer
